# From Fedora to Debian

I have been using Fedora for two years since the incidental deletion of Windows 8.1 bundled with my laptop. However, I recently switch to Debian, because I have had Fedora enough.

Debian is better tweaked. Packages shipped with Fedora are barely usable because of lack of tweaks. I did not realize it until I tried Debian. Some well-tweaked examples are gnome and bash.

Debian is better documented. The wiki of Debian always has almost everything I want to know. However, Fedora wiki and documentary pages cover only the most foundamental aspect. What's more, although Fedora forum contains lots of information, discussions on newest release are scarce.

DNF is awkward. A week ago, I installed eclipse with dnf and found a strange problem. While following the instructions in eclipse tutorial, an exception occurred. I searched on Internet and found that ONLY fedora users have the same problem. I tried to find solutions in Fedora forum and wiki, but failed.

Debian does have some drawbacks. The major one is that packages in repository are a little out-of-date. It does not matter unless the user is a developer who requires latest tools. Nevertheless, it is much easier for developers to deploy developing environments than to tweak softwares out of their fields, which is what I felt during the days with Fedora.
