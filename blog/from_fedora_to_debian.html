<p>I have been using Fedora for two years since the incidental deletion of Windows 8.1 bundled with my laptop. However, I recently switch to Debian, because I have had Fedora enough.</p>

<p>Debian is better tweaked. Packages shipped with Fedora are barely usable because of lack of tweaks. I did not realize it until I tried Debian. Some well-tweaked examples are gnome and bash.</p>

<p>Debian is better documented. The wiki of Debian always has almost everything I want to know. However, Fedora wiki and documentary pages cover only the most foundamental aspect. What's more, although Fedora forum contains lots of information, discussions on newest fedora release are scarce.</p>

<p>DNF is awkward. A week ago, I installed eclipse with dnf and found a strange problem. While following the instructions provided by eclipse tutorial, an exception occurred. I searched on Internet and found that ONLY fedora users have the same problem. I tried to find solutions in Fedora forum and wiki, but failed.</p>

<p>Debian does have some drawbacks. The major one is that packages in repository are a little out-of-date. Nevertheless, it is much easier for developers to deploy developing environments of their interest, than to tweak software out of their field, which is what I felt when using Fedora.</p>
