## Thinking on Bioinformatics

2016-11-22

I believe that organisms can do anything physically possible. So remained problems are how organisms process information carried by substance. To be more specific, I need to know the mechanism of information storage, utilization and communication in and among organisms. And the key points are storage and communication.

_Homo sapiens_ uses nerve system, especially the brain, to remember. But how a brain works remains unknown, at least for me. Human individuals communicate through voice and gesture. Within a human body, cells communicate through chemical (e.g. hormone) and electronic (e.g. nerve impulse) message. Within a eukaryotic cell, cell compartments communicate with molecules that cross membranes or can interact with membrane proteins. 

I know little about how things happen in a cell. That is what I am currently most intereted in.
