## Artificial Organism

2016-10-27

I have been thinking about creating an artificial organism for a long time. I think we had better start by creating some part of a cell instead of whole ones. Recently, an idea came up. It is now solid enough to be recored on my blog (here). 

We can firstly create a cell without cytoplasma membrane. That is, it is a gel of organic materials including DNAs, RNA polymerases, ribosomes and other biological complexes required in expression of primary genes. Concentration of NTPs and other consumables are maintein by periodical adding into the gel. All sorts of gargages are also removed periodically.

The advantage of creating an artificial living gel firstly is that it avoids the complexity of cytoplasma membrane and a series of metabolic pathways.
