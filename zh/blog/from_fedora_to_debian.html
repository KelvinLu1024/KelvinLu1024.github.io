<h1>From Fedora to Debian</h1>
<p>2016-10-25</p>
<p>I have been using Fedora for two years since the incidental deletion of Windows 8.1 bundled with my laptop. However, I recently switch to Debian, because I have had Fedora enough.</p>
<p>Debian is better tweaked. Packages shipped with Fedora are barely usable because of lack of tweaks. I did not realize it until I tried Debian. Some well-tweaked examples are gnome and bash.</p>
<p>Debian is better documented. The wiki of Debian always has almost everything I want to know. However, Fedora wiki and documentary pages cover only the most foundamental aspect. What's more, although Fedora forum contains lots of information, discussions on newest release are scarce.</p>
<p>DNF is awkward. A week ago, I installed eclipse with dnf and found a strange problem. While following the instructions in eclipse tutorial, an exception occurred. I searched on Internet and found that ONLY fedora users have the same problem. I tried to find solutions in Fedora forum and wiki, but failed.</p>
<p>Debian does have some drawbacks. The major one is that packages in repository are a little out-of-date. It does not matter unless the user is a developer who requires latest tools. Nevertheless, it is much easier for developers to deploy developing environments than to tweak softwares out of their fields, which is what I felt during the days with Fedora.</p>
