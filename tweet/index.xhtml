<p>I need a structual S-expression editor to write scheme program!</p></article>

<p>I am recently studying assembly. I prefer RISC over CISC because of love of simplicity. And I prefer MIPS over other RISC assemblies (SPARC, RISC-V), because I found a wonderful learning resouce on it. Here is the resource.</p>

<p>Files are encoding of data structures. They should be decoded back to data structure before any other operations. In another words, it is WRONG to operate directly on strings in the files. </p></article>

<article><p>2016-11-26</p>
<p>It seems that gene or gene cluster may `lock' other genes or gene clusters. The locking can be achieved through miRNA silience, DNA heterochromatinization or depressor. Can we find out the locking network?</p></article>

<article><p>2016-11-26</p>
<p>Generally, two types of signaling are required: broadcast and point-to-point communication. For cells of an multicellular animal, hormone acts as broadcast signal while neural impulse as point-to-point one. Point-to-point approach can be simulated by combining broadcasting and filting, however, the former seems more efficient. </p></article>

<p>In these two terms, I have learned in different lessons so many programming language: </p>
<ul>
<li>AWK</li>
<li>sed</li>
<li>bash</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>MatLab</li>
</ul>
<p>WTF</p></article>

<article><p>2016-11-11</p>
<p>A bad day with Scheme is much better than a good day with C/C++. And I had a bad day with C++. Sad.</p></article>

<article><p>2016-11-10</p>
<p>Expressiveness of programming language matters. As programmers tend to write shorter code, they prefer paradigms easier to express in the programming language. In other words, a language which has limited expressiveness is likely to prevent its users from paradigms that are easy to think of but hard to express.

<p>Love is a Fallacy (written by Max Shulman) is so funny!</p></article>

<p>If I can find out the origin of each base in genomes, horizontal transfered sequences will emerge.</p></article>
