# Days with XFce

Last time I reinstalled Fedora for my laptop, I choosed xfce instead of Gnome or KDE as I used to. These days with xfce are really comfortable. XFce is tractable and respects my customs.

## vs KDE 
KDE is undoubtly more configurable and beautiful than xfce. However, KDE is also larger and takes more time to lauch. Appearance matters less than speed, which push me from KDE to XFce.

## vs Gnome
Gnome does not even respect my right of freedom. It lacks some critical configuration, for example, I cannot find a way to customize the shortcut of gedit. What's more, the cofigurating process is sometime horrible. To add a shortcut "Open Terminal Here" for the file browser of Gnome, I has to install another software called "nautilus-open-terminal". While Thunar, the file browser of xfce, provides "Edit > Configure custom actions". I can add the functionality by myself with basic knowledge of command line. 

## Conclusion
Gnome is evil.
