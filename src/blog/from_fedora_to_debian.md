# From Fedora to Debian

2016-10-25

I have been using Fedora for two years, however, I recently switch to Debian, because Debian is more user-friendly.

Debian is better tweaked. Packages shipped with Fedora are barely usable because of lack of tweaks. For example, both Gnome desktop environment and bash are more usable in dafault setting in Debian.

Debian is better documented. The wiki of Debian covers almost everything I want to know about the daily life with the distribution. However, Fedora wiki and documentary pages cover only the most foundamental issues. What's more, although Fedora forum contains lots of information, discussions on newest release are scarce.

dnf, the package-managing utility of Fedora, is awkward. A week ago, I installed Eclipse with dnf and found a strange problem: I failed to follow the instructions in Eclipse's tutorial. I did some searches on Internet and found that ONLY fedora users have the same problem. I tried to find solutions in Fedora forum and wiki, but failed. It made me really upset.

Debian does have some drawbacks. The most significant one is that packages in Debian's main repository are a little out-of-date. But this problem is not so critical, because only developers are likely to require latest softwares of limited fields and it is common for developers to deploy developing enviroment by their own.
